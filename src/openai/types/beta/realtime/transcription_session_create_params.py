    and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.
    Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction
    with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then
    dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio
    trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and
    wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more
    natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.
