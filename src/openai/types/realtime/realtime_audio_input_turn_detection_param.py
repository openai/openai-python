    eagerness: Literal["low", "medium", "high", "auto"]
    """Used only for `semantic_vad` mode.

    The eagerness of the model to respond. `low` will wait longer for the user to
    continue speaking, `high` will respond more quickly. `auto` is the default and
    is equivalent to `medium`. `low`, `medium`, and `high` have max timeouts of 8s,
    4s, and 2s respectively.

    idle_timeout_ms: Optional[int]
    """
    Optional idle timeout after which turn detection will auto-timeout when no
    additional audio is received and emits a `timeout_triggered` event.
    """

    interrupt_response: bool
    """
    Whether or not to automatically interrupt any ongoing response with output to
    the default conversation (i.e. `conversation` of `auto`) when a VAD start event
    occurs.

    Amount of audio to include before the VAD detected speech (in milliseconds).

    Duration of silence to detect speech stop (in milliseconds). Defaults to 500ms.

    short pauses from the user.

    threshold: float
    """Used only for `server_vad` mode.

    Activation threshold for VAD (0.0 to 1.0), this defaults to 0.5. A higher
    threshold will require louder audio to activate the model, and thus might
    perform better in noisy environments.
