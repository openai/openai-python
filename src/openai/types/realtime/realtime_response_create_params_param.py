    Currently supports `auto` and `none`, with `auto` as the default value. The

    Using this field creates a new context for this Response instead of using the

    Response. Note that this can include references to items that previously

    system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide
    the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content
    and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of
    good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion
    into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be
    followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired
