    The eagerness of the model to respond. `low` will wait longer for the user to
    continue speaking, `high` will respond more quickly. `auto` is the default and
    is equivalent to `medium`.

    idle_timeout_ms: Optional[int]

    Optional idle timeout after which turn detection will auto-timeout when no
    additional audio is received.

    Whether or not to automatically interrupt any ongoing response with output to
    the default conversation (i.e. `conversation` of `auto`) when a VAD start event
    occurs.

    Amount of audio to include before the VAD detected speech (in milliseconds).

    short pauses from the user.

    Activation threshold for VAD (0.0 to 1.0), this defaults to 0.5. A higher

    perform better in noisy environments.
