    Configuration for input audio transcription, defaults to off and can be set to

    asynchronously through
    [the /audio/transcriptions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription)

    what the model heard. The client can optionally set the language and prompt for

    This can be set to `null` to turn off, in which case the client must manually
    trigger model response. Server VAD means that the model will detect the start
    and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.
    Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjunction
    with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then
    dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio
    trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and
    wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more
    natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.
