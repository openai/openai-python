    When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token

    4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the context before
    truncation occurs. Clients can configure truncation behavior to truncate with a
    lower max token limit, which is an effective way to control token usage and
    cost. Truncation will reduce the number of cached tokens on the next turn
    (busting the cache), since messages are dropped from the beginning of the
    context. However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up to
    a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future
    truncations and thus improve the cache rate. Truncation can be disabled
    entirely, which means the server will never truncate but would instead return an
    error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token limit.
