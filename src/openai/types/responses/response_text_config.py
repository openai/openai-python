    Configuring `{ "type": "json_schema" }` enables Structured Outputs, which

    [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

    The default format is `{ "type": "text" }` with no additional options.

    **Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:**

    Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
    ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
    preferred for models that support it.
