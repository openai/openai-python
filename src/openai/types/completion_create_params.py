    Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during

    """
    Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with
    the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

    When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and
    `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

    **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly
    consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable

    [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs.
    Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to
    sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1
    should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
    should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

    As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token
    from being generated.

    logprobs: Optional[int]
    """
    Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as
    well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a
    list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of
    the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

    The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

    The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the

    top_p: Optional[float]

    An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
