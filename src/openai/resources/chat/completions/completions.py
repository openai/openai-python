        Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the
        [text generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
        [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
        [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like
              [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
              [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a
              wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics,
              and price points. Refer to the
              [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare
              available models.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o-series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable
              of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o-series models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing
                service tier.
                [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing).
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

              Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream: If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is
              generated using
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).
              See the
              [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming)
              for more information, along with the
              [streaming responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses)
              guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

          web_search_options: This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more
              about the
              [web search tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a
              wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics,
              and price points. Refer to the
              [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare
              available models.

          stream: If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is
              generated using
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).
              See the
              [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming)
              for more information, along with the
              [streaming responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses)
              guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o-series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable
              of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o-series models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing
                service tier.
                [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing).
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

              Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

          web_search_options: This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more
              about the
              [web search tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat).

              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing
                service tier.
                [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing).
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

              Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

          web_search_options: This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more
              about the
              [web search tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat).

        Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the
        [text generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
        [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
        [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like
              [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
              [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a
              wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics,
              and price points. Refer to the
              [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare
              available models.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o-series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable
              of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o-series models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing
                service tier.
                [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing).
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

              Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream: If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is
              generated using
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).
              See the
              [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming)
              for more information, along with the
              [streaming responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses)
              guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

          web_search_options: This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more
              about the
              [web search tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable
              of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o-series models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
              ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
              preferred for models that support it.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing
                service tier.
                [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing).
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

              Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

        [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
        [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like
              [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
              [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a
              wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics,
              and price points. Refer to the
              [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare
              available models.

          stream: If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is
              generated using
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).
              See the
              [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming)
              for more information, along with the
              [streaming responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses)
              guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o-series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
