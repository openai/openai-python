        [text generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
        [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
        [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like
              [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
              [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the
              [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#model-endpoint-compatibility)
              table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o1 series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most
              models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o1 models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarantee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o1 series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most
              models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o1 models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarantee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like

              table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.

        [text generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
        [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
        [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like
              [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
              [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the
              [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#model-endpoint-compatibility)
              table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o1 series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most
              models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o1 models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarantee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

        [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
        [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

        Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the
        response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only
        supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of
        unsupported parameters in reasoning models,
        [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the
              [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message
              types (modalities) are supported, like
              [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation),
              [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and
              [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the
              [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#model-endpoint-compatibility)
              table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          audio: Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
              `modalities: ["audio"]`.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

              `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

              `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
              function.

              Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model
              to call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and
              [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion. This value can be used to control
              [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o1 series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most
              models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o1 models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarantee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.

              This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not
              compatible with
              [o1 series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

          metadata: Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful
              for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and
              querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

              Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
              a maximum length of 512 characters.

          modalities: Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most
              models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

              `["text"]`

              The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to
              [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that
              this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

              `["text", "audio"]`

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether to enable
              [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
              during tool use.

          prediction: Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
              being regenerated.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: **o1 models only**

              Constrains effort on reasoning for
              [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
              supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
              result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
              in the
              [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
                utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
              - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
                be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
                latency guarantee.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          store: Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
              our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
              or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
              not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
              the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that tool.

              `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
              are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
